## Project Description

This project was originally started in week 8 of my MIT Professional Certificate in Coding course. Upon opening the file you'll see two eyes that follow your mouse around the screen.

## Installation

Download all files to the same location on your machine. Drag the eyes.html file on to your browser.

## Roadmap

Future updates to this project will include randomized background colors with clicking.
